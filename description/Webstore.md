How I Watch 72 Hours of YouTube Videos a Day (And You Can Too) 🤯

I'm not kidding. While most people struggle to finish a 20-minute tutorial, I'm consuming the equivalent of 72 hours of content daily thanks to my extension Summarizerrrr.

Here's the reality: We're drowning in valuable content but starving for time to consume it all. YouTube tutorials, Reddit discussions, lengthy articles - everywhere you look, there's something worth learning, but who has hours to spend on each piece?

That's exactly why I built Summarizerrrr.

💥 The Real Problems We All Face 💥

📚 Information Overload is Killing Our Learning
You bookmark that 2-hour course, save that detailed article, add that tutorial to "watch later" - and then never actually get through any of it. Sound familiar?

🌍 Language and Learning Barriers Are Everywhere
Amazing content exists in languages you don't speak, or it's explained in ways that don't match how you learn best.

🧩 Content is Scattered Across Platforms
The information you need is spread across YouTube, Reddit, articles, courses - there's no unified way to process it all efficiently.
