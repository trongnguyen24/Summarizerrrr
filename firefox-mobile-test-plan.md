# Firefox Mobile Test Plan

## Objective

Verify that the Firefox mobile streaming fix works correctly by testing the extension on Firefox mobile browser.

## Test Environment

- Firefox mobile browser (latest version)
- Android device (recommended) or Firefox mobile simulator
- Extension installed and configured with valid API keys

## Test Cases

### 1. Browser Detection

- [ ] Verify that Firefox mobile is correctly detected
- [ ] Verify that non-Firefox browsers are not affected
- [ ] Verify that Firefox desktop is not affected

### 2. Streaming Behavior

- [ ] Verify that streaming is disabled on Firefox mobile
- [ ] Verify that streaming still works on other browsers
- [ ] Verify that smooth streaming is disabled on Firefox mobile
- [ ] Verify that smooth streaming still works on other browsers

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

- [ ] Verify that summarization works on Firefox mobile using fallback to non-streaming
- [ ] Verify that YouTube video summarization works on Firefox mobile
- [ ] Verify that YouTube chapter summarization works on Firefox mobile
- [ ] Verify that general content summarization works on Firefox mobile

### 4. Error Handling

- [ ] Verify that "Permission denied to access property 'flush'" errors are no longer occurring
- [ ] Verify that appropriate error messages are shown to users if fallback fails
- [ ] Verify that console logs show correct fallback behavior

### 5. Performance

- [ ] Verify that summarization performance is acceptable on Firefox mobile
- [ ] Verify that there are no significant delays in fallback mode
- [ ] Verify that memory usage is reasonable

## Testing Steps

### Setup

1. Install the extension on Firefox mobile
2. Configure API keys for at least one provider (e.g., Gemini)
3. Navigate to a test webpage with content to summarize

### Test Execution

1. Open the extension on Firefox mobile
2. Attempt to summarize content
3. Observe behavior and console logs
4. Verify that summarization completes successfully
5. Check that no "Permission denied" errors occur
6. Repeat for different content types (web pages, YouTube videos, etc.)

### Verification

1. Check console logs for Firefox mobile detection
2. Check console logs for streaming fallback messages
3. Verify that summary content is generated correctly
4. Verify that user experience is smooth and error-free

## Expected Results

- No "Permission denied to access property 'flush'" errors
- Successful summarization on Firefox mobile using fallback
- Normal streaming behavior on other browsers
- Appropriate console logging for debugging
- Good performance and user experience

## Troubleshooting

If issues are encountered:

1. Check console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify API key configuration
3. Ensure browser detection is working correctly
4. Confirm fallback mechanism is triggered appropriately
