# Firefox Mobile Fix - Final Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Original Streaming Issue ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: "Permission denied to access property 'flush'" error on Firefox Mobile
**Solution**:

- Added browser detection to automatically disable streaming on Firefox Mobile
- Implemented fallback to non-streaming methods
- Added graceful error handling

### 2. Console Error Issue ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: `TypeError: "warn" is read-only` error on Firefox Mobile
**Solution**:

- Replaced all `console.warn()` calls with `console.log()` in affected files
- Firefox Mobile has stricter console object restrictions

### 3. UI Loading State Issue ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: MobileSheet component stuck in loading state even after successful summarization
**Solution**:

- Fixed the status display logic in MobileSheet.svelte
- Changed from duplicate status derivation to using the composable's status directly

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/utils/browserDetection.js**

   - Fixed console.warn → console.log

2. **src/lib/api/aiSdkAdapter.js**

   - Fixed console.warn → console.log

3. **src/entrypoints/content/services/SummarizationService.js**

4. **src/entrypoints/content/components/MobileSheet.svelte**
   - Fixed UI loading state logic

## Test Results

Based on the logs provided:

- ✅ Firefox Mobile detection working correctly
- ✅ Streaming disabled automatically
- ✅ Summarization completing successfully (`[useSummarization] Summarization completed in 15229ms`)
- ✅ Fallback to non-streaming working
- ✅ No more "Permission denied" errors

## What Was Working vs What Needed Fixing

**Already Working (Streaming Fix):**

- Browser detection

- Core summarization functionality

**Fixed Issues:**

- Console.warn read-only errors
- UI loading state not clearing properly
- State synchronization between composable and component

1. No streaming errors
2. No console errors
3. Proper UI state management
4. Successful summarization using fallback methods
